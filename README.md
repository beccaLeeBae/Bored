# Bored
Bored is a web app that helps you find something to do when you have nothing to do.

## MVP
- Users can sign up and log in
- Users can search for movies currently playing in theaters near them or TV shows/sporting events
- Users can choose to go to Seamless.com to order food to go with their show of choice (_"make an evening of it"_)
- Users can save and delete "bored" history

## User Stories
- My plans fell through for the weekend and now I have nothing to do. I'm going to be sitting at home and need something to watch.
- My in-laws are visiting and I need to leave the house. Preferably somewhere without cell reception and an overwhelming smell of buttered popcorn.
- My girlfriend wants to stay in tonight and can't make a decision to save her life. What do we watch?

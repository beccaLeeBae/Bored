# Bored
Bored is a web app that helps you find something to do when you have nothing to do.

## MVP
- Users can create an account
- Users can search for TV shows movies currently playing in theaters near them
- Bored will recommend a user to stay at home if the current temperature at their location is below freezing
- Users can choose to go to Seamless.com to order food to go with their TV show of choice or restaurants near their location
- Users can see how many times they chose to stay in or go out

## User Stories
- My plans fell through for the weekend and now I have nothing to do. I'm going to be sitting at home and need something to watch.
- My in-laws are visiting and I need to leave the house. Preferably somewhere without cell reception and an overwhelming smell of buttered popcorn.
- My girlfriend wants to stay in tonight and can't make a decision to save her life. What do we watch?
